            <h1>Artificial intelligence</h1>
            <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is the intelligence of machines or software, as opposed to the intelligence
                of humans or other animals. It is a field of study in computer science that develops and studies
                intelligent machines. Such machines may be called AIs.

                AI technology is widely used throughout industry, government, and science. Some high-profile
                applications are: advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search), recommendation systems (used by
                YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix), understanding human speech (such as Google Assistant, Siri, and Alexa),
                self-driving cars (e.g., Waymo), generative and creative tools (ChatGPT and AI art), and superhuman play
                and analysis in strategy games (such as chess and Go).[1]

                Alan Turing was the first person to conduct substantial research in the field that he called Machine
                Intelligence.[2] Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956.[3] The field
                went through multiple cycles of optimism[4][5] followed by disappointment and loss of funding.[6][7]
                Funding and interest vastly increased after 2012 when deep learning surpassed all previous AI
                techniques,[8] and after 2017 with the transformer architecture.[9] This led to the AI spring of the
                early 2020s, with companies, universities, and laboratories overwhelmingly based in the United States
                pioneering significant advances in artificial intelligence.[10]
